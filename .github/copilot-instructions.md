# Zig Copilot Instructions

## NEVER create upstream pull requests

The Zig project explicitly bans AI-generated contributions (code, issues, PRs, and comments).
See: https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/
See: https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Community/issues/2458

**Do NOT:**
- Create pull requests targeting codeberg.org/ziglang/zig
- Create issues on codeberg.org/ziglang/zig
- Post comments on codeberg.org/ziglang/zig

All work must stay in the cataggar or ctaggart forks on GitHub. Any upstream
contributions must be manually submitted by a human after thorough review.

## GitHub account usage

The `ctaggart/zig` repo is owned by a different GitHub account than `cataggar/zig`.
To perform admin operations (e.g. changing default branch, dispatching workflows),
switch accounts:

```powershell
gh auth switch --user ctaggart   # for ctaggart-owned repos
gh auth switch --user cataggar   # to switch back
```
